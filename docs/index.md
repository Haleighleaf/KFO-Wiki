# Welcome to Killing Fever Online Wiki

Killing Fever Online is a server designed for hosting role-plays of all kinds! (Lots of ones with plenty of murder and mystery.) Zero Escape, Danganronpa, Steins;Gate, Ace Attorney, Professor Layton and several other visual novels are our prime inspirations. We enjoy murder mysteries, character drama, creative gameplay and silly plots that make the RP's real fun to be in! We take our RP's seriously, though we value fun above all else, so if you want to be fully immersed in a roleplay we're hoping to achieve that effect!

This wiki's purpose is to serve as the Killing Fever Online knowledge base, documenting what we learned as we explore many types and styles of roleplaying formats, to aid the game masters, content creators and players in creation of those formats!
