[Thu Dec 18 12:06:44 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): wait @smiles, does grabbing still use form as the stat to roll?
[Thu Dec 18 12:06:47 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): this sprite so goofy
[Thu Dec 18 12:06:59 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): pretty sure yeah
[Thu Dec 18 12:07:07 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): endurance is avoiding the grab at all
[Thu Dec 18 12:07:09 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): alrighty we rollin with that
[Thu Dec 18 12:07:11 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): form is getting out of it
[Thu Dec 18 12:07:16 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): gotcha
[Thu Dec 18 12:07:46 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): also are you guys familiar with the music playlist?? you guys will be able to change it anytime since I'm not familiar with it at all
[Thu Dec 18 12:08:09 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): are these like ex sprites so many of these are just minor variations of the previous expressions
[Thu Dec 18 12:08:36 2025 GMT] Redfield (Nichody): What do you mean by 'changing it'?
[Thu Dec 18 12:08:50 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): picking the song to play
[Thu Dec 18 12:08:57 2025 GMT] Guy has stopped the music: 
[Thu Dec 18 12:09:01 2025 GMT] Redfield (Nichody): Ah,i'm perfectly capable of that.
[Thu Dec 18 12:09:09 2025 GMT] Guy has played a song: upbeat and weird/[AAI] Noisy People.ogg
[Thu Dec 18 12:09:24 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): i constantly forget to until cw starts yelling in the globat chat to CHANGE THE MUSIIIIIIIC
[Thu Dec 18 12:09:29 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): we ball then!
[Thu Dec 18 12:09:41 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): For some odd reason I cannot hear the music playing at all which is weird
[Thu Dec 18 12:09:56 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): but that's fine so uhhhh just leaving you guys the aux cord
[Thu Dec 18 12:10:17 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): anyways redfield you can have one more perk
[Thu Dec 18 12:10:27 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): since you added a trauma
[Thu Dec 18 12:10:45 2025 GMT] Redfield (Yew): Alright uuhhhh
[Thu Dec 18 12:11:29 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): every trauma added gets you either two extra attribute points or another perk
[Thu Dec 18 12:11:53 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): i usually take an extra perk but i ended up desciding i needed to compensate my endurance and scavenging this time
[Thu Dec 18 12:12:21 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): damn we really out here minmaxxing
[Thu Dec 18 12:12:43 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): ~TESTING~
[Thu Dec 18 12:12:48 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): #TESTING#
[Thu Dec 18 12:12:54 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): okay I hope that red markdown shows
[Thu Dec 18 12:13:01 2025 GMT] Redfield (Yew): The first one did.
[Thu Dec 18 12:13:02 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): endurance just sucked on me for being the dodging stat and scavenging makes lore sense to be higher given the character background
[Thu Dec 18 12:13:05 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): first one yeah
[Thu Dec 18 12:13:11 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): second one exploded
[Thu Dec 18 12:13:19 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): right ok
[Thu Dec 18 12:13:29 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): I'm using the dro client to play so 
[Thu Dec 18 12:13:35 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): I'll keep it in mind
[Thu Dec 18 12:13:58 2025 GMT] Redfield (Yew): Alright,i've done another perk.
[Thu Dec 18 12:14:03 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): lemme see
[Thu Dec 18 12:14:08 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): we have short rests???
[Thu Dec 18 12:14:16 2025 GMT] Redfield (Yew): We have long rests,soooo
[Thu Dec 18 12:14:16 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): Nope at least not now
[Thu Dec 18 12:14:25 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): Long Rest I just bullshitted it in the archive
[Thu Dec 18 12:14:25 2025 GMT] Redfield (Yew): Okay,let me change it up then
[Thu Dec 18 12:14:31 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): there's resting at all damn
[Thu Dec 18 12:14:44 2025 GMT] Redfield (Yew): How about,3 rerolls per sessions?
[Thu Dec 18 12:14:47 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): Since the barista's character kit would be kinda busted if I didn't balance it properly
[Thu Dec 18 12:14:53 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): yeah sure that works for me
[Thu Dec 18 12:15:09 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): is scruffy even still here
[Thu Dec 18 12:15:15 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): nah they had to dip
[Thu Dec 18 12:15:21 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): session time too early kekw
[Thu Dec 18 12:15:28 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): are they going to like that potential rerun session
[Thu Dec 18 12:15:42 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): probably???
[Thu Dec 18 12:16:07 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): I hope they can make it if I rerun this because I tried to balance it out as best as I could lmfao
[Thu Dec 18 12:16:19 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): at least now i can learn whether or not it's fun to be the kickass girl
[Thu Dec 18 12:16:19 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): anyways five minutes if nobody else turns up we can start with just two
[Thu Dec 18 12:16:45 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): i've been tech boy, zombie detector girl, and now kickass girl
[Thu Dec 18 12:17:03 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): I already planned utilizing NPCs and such this session so you guys won't be the only two interacting with each other at least
[Thu Dec 18 12:17:21 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): use the npc as a human shield
[Thu Dec 18 12:17:40 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): sure if you want too LOL
[Thu Dec 18 12:17:47 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): you can definitely do that
[Thu Dec 18 12:17:54 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): just that there is uhh, consequences
[Thu Dec 18 12:18:04 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): watch as bro has to make all the encounters easier to compensate for there only being two players
[Thu Dec 18 12:18:23 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): ahahahaha yeah

[Thu Dec 18 12:19:12 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): also smiles do you mind streaming the session in vc so I could hear the music or is that maybe a bit too much
[OOC][Thu Dec 18 12:19:18 2025 GMT] Smiles: you can throw together a character and join
[Thu Dec 18 12:19:28 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): never did that but i can try

[Thu Dec 18 12:23:41 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): it shall be loud af unless i figure out how to adjust it on my end without messing up your end
[Thu Dec 18 12:23:47 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): Also redfield is your character in the base files?? Can't see your sprites for some reason
[Thu Dec 18 12:23:59 2025 GMT] Redfield (Yew): It is,in KFO's base files.
[Thu Dec 18 12:24:09 2025 GMT] Redfield (Yew): You did download KFO's files,right?
[Thu Dec 18 12:24:16 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): Huh, I've downloaded the kfo character files
[Thu Dec 18 12:24:27 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): i can see them???
[Thu Dec 18 12:24:38 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): I legit need to clean my pc at this point I cannot live like this
[Thu Dec 18 12:25:16 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): also smiles how do you hide the name of a player in the playerlist
[Thu Dec 18 12:25:24 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): once again I ask for patience I am very new
[Thu Dec 18 12:25:29 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): time for bro to just be seeing missingnos until i record the demo
[Thu Dec 18 12:25:40 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): the wha
[Thu Dec 18 12:25:54 2025 GMT] Redfield (Yew): It's an DRO feature
[Thu Dec 18 12:26:00 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): oh nevermind I just
[Thu Dec 18 12:26:03 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): YEAH THAT
[Thu Dec 18 12:26:06 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): okay ballin
[Thu Dec 18 12:26:26 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): lol oops i never heard of that feature (kfo client user)
[Thu Dec 18 12:26:32 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): @Detectiv lmk if you need help creating your perks and stuff
[Thu Dec 18 12:26:55 2025 GMT] Redfield (Yew): I understand,it's also a feature on webao
[Thu Dec 18 12:27:03 2025 GMT] Redfield (Yew): But only WTP uses it as far as i'm aware.
[Thu Dec 18 12:27:08 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): Oh damn 
[Thu Dec 18 12:27:20 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): When I tried webao it was kinda janky
[Thu Dec 18 12:27:37 2025 GMT] Angela: Yeah, I probably will need help, considering it's my first time.
[Thu Dec 18 12:28:05 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): That's fine! Have you read through the game rules and figured out how to sort stats and all that?
[Thu Dec 18 12:28:35 2025 GMT] Angela: 15 points on 5 Attributes, right?
[Thu Dec 18 12:28:40 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): yup
[Thu Dec 18 12:29:02 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): one stat = +1 additional modifier on your rolls that require that certain stat
[Thu Dec 18 12:29:34 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): imagine someone spamming trauma just to get a bunch of attribute points
[Thu Dec 18 12:29:51 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): you can make up any perk you want, like having extra inventory, starting with a certain item at the start of the session like a camera or a weapon, detecting if there is danger in the area, and so on
[Thu Dec 18 12:30:10 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): like i think it's a max of four traumas so someone could theoretically have like 23 points to spend
[Thu Dec 18 12:30:20 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): jfc
[Thu Dec 18 12:31:25 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): i think if i took like three traumas and made them all attribute point additions i'd be able to get a four minimum in everything
[Thu Dec 18 12:32:13 2025 GMT] Redfield (Yew): Or 4 maxed out attributes if you don't touch awareness
[Thu Dec 18 12:32:17 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): just by spreading the points between endurance and awareness
[Thu Dec 18 12:32:34 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): I'd also like it if we can start in about 10 or 15 mins soon so @Detectiv let me know if you need help in making up perks and traumas (that is, IF you want a Trauma)
[Thu Dec 18 12:32:57 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): girl gets so good she stops having to think
[Thu Dec 18 12:33:04 2025 GMT] Angela: We can start without one?
[Thu Dec 18 12:33:16 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): yeah they're optional
[Thu Dec 18 12:33:19 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): yeah you don't necessarily need a trauma
[Thu Dec 18 12:33:24 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): they're just there if you want more perks
[Thu Dec 18 12:33:27 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): or more stats
[Thu Dec 18 12:33:30 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): they're just to get other bonuses
[Thu Dec 18 12:34:08 2025 GMT] Redfield (Yew): Would be great if that was mentionned in the rules.
[Thu Dec 18 12:34:23 2025 GMT] Angela: Agreed.
[Thu Dec 18 12:34:32 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): oh it isn't?
[Thu Dec 18 12:34:41 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): huh i thought it was
[Thu Dec 18 12:34:43 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): alrighty I'll get that noted down then
[Thu Dec 18 12:34:46 2025 GMT] Redfield (Yew): The fact that they are optional
[Thu Dec 18 12:34:50 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): maybe we gotta fix the rules again
[Thu Dec 18 12:34:57 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): they are kinda like extremely new
[Thu Dec 18 12:35:00 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): yeah the rules are still definitely still a work in progress
[Thu Dec 18 12:35:11 2025 GMT] Redfield (Yew): Baby steps
[Thu Dec 18 12:35:17 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): this game mode started getting serious development literally this week lol
[Thu Dec 18 12:35:21 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): we just got the foundations out rn so
[Thu Dec 18 12:36:13 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): proud member of the "joined a random one off cw called out of nowhere and ended up having such a peak experience she decided to help there be more" gang
[Thu Dec 18 12:37:39 2025 GMT] Angela: Ok, I really don't know what perk to  make.
[Thu Dec 18 12:37:46 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): okay so
[Thu Dec 18 12:37:51 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): which stat do you want to specialize in
[Thu Dec 18 12:38:02 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): you can always just steal one of the perks from a previous session
[Thu Dec 18 12:38:07 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): all of your stats add up to 25 btw
[Thu Dec 18 12:38:16 2025 GMT] Redfield (Yew): Like danger sense?
[Thu Dec 18 12:38:21 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): stats seem to be a wip for them
[Thu Dec 18 12:38:27 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): like if you specialize awareness you can try danger sense
[Thu Dec 18 12:38:32 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): yeah you can reuse perks from other characters if you want
[Thu Dec 18 12:38:39 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): and force the gm to tell you when there's nearby danger
[Thu Dec 18 12:38:50 2025 GMT] Smiles (Sonia): and block all the ambushes
[Thu Dec 18 12:38:53 2025 GMT] Ike (Ema): you only have 15 points in total to spend for all your stats

[Thu Dec 18 15:53:21 2025 GMT] Kaela Aeona (Sonia): then no i somehow pass the endurance for it
[Thu Dec 18 15:53:36 2025 GMT] Redfield (Yew): Maybe i'll do that next time.

[Thu Dec 18 15:54:29 2025 GMT] RJ (Nao): TBH I prolly could've done the same with max, but I don't want him busted. Just strong.
[Thu Dec 18 15:54:41 2025 GMT] RJ (Nao): Next sesh I use him. ~7~ form

[Thu Dec 18 15:54:54 2025 GMT] Redfield (Yew): Hercules among humans
[Thu Dec 18 15:55:05 2025 GMT] Kaela Aeona (Sonia): theoretically you can take bonus points for the max of four traumas and get nearly perfect stats
[Thu Dec 18 15:55:10 2025 GMT] RJ (Q-Taro): This dude does look like a 7 Form.

[Thu Dec 18 15:55:51 2025 GMT] RJ (Q-Taro): 4 Traumas is the max. I like making Traumas. They make my gameplay so diffrent depending on what they are

[Thu Dec 18 16:04:55 2025 GMT] Kaela Aeona (Sonia): the meta is spending your trauma on either the most busted perk you can think of or making almost every stat above average
[Thu Dec 18 16:05:01 2025 GMT] RJ (Nao): Guns can be a melee weapon
[Thu Dec 18 16:05:09 2025 GMT] Redfield (Yew): We don't have inifnite time though,so i think scavenge should be a medium stat everytime
