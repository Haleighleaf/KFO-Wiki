[Wed Dec 17 22:10:24 2025 GMT] Smiles (Chihiro): especially since it costs a whole slow action
[Wed Dec 17 22:10:34 2025 GMT] Brook: I'd say +2 at minimum
[Wed Dec 17 22:10:37 2025 GMT] Brook: to make it useful

[Wed Dec 17 22:13:53 2025 GMT] CW (Brook): So yah. Endurance is now used for dodging Zombie Bites, and also running from zombies during chase.
[Wed Dec 17 22:14:03 2025 GMT] CW (Brook): That makes Endurance the defensive stat while Form is the offensive stat.

[Wed Dec 17 22:22:43 2025 GMT] RJ (Q-Taro): Ayy. I based my character based off being good in groups and weaker alone.
[Wed Dec 17 22:23:13 2025 GMT] Smiles (Chihiro): we literally could NOT split up last time
[Wed Dec 17 22:23:15 2025 GMT] RJ (Q-Taro): Let me read the rules then ask questions.
